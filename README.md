# nwHacks 2022: mytinerary

COVID-19 brought the momentum of the travel industry to a halt, with travel bans and restrictions leaving many craving adventures and new experiences. However, planning can be a long and tedious process that takes away a lot of the fun. Our project mytinerary aims to help travelers by generating a personalized itinerary within minutes. A user is first asked to submit their desired location, travel dates, interests, and preferred level of busyness. Our algorithm then creates the ideal schedule, which is downloadable in PDF and ICS file formats. To create this project, we used Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and the Yelp Fusion API to search for relevant attractions. In particular, we made use of the distance feature to ensure that our users never have to travel more than a few kilometres to reach their next event. In addition, we avoid scheduling similar activities to guarantee fun and unique travel experiences.
